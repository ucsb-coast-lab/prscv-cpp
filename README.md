# prscv-cpp

This is the C++ front-end of a C++/Rust computer vision library. The `prscv` folder can be cloned from [this](https://github.com/ucsb-coast-lab/prscv.git) repostory. Please note that it includes the `opencv-rust` crate, which takes up quite a lot of space and takes a while for the initial compilation step. 

```bash 
$ git clone https://github.com/ucsb-coast-lab/prscv-cpp.git
$ cd prscv-cpp
$ git clone https://github.com/ucsb-coast-lab/prscv.git
$ ./build.sh
$ ./process_image
```
